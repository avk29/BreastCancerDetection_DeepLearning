# BreastCancerDetection_DeepLearning
Detecting breast cancer in mammogram images using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** based **Deep Learning model**.


## Problem Statement
- Conventional detection of breast cancer tumours in mammograms is a complex task that involves clinical examination, radiological imaging, and pathology testing and can only be accomplished by domain experts.

- These methods can be automated using machine learning which relies on numerical attributes. However, feature detection continues to be to be a manual task and can be further overcome using deep learning approaches.

- Hence, in my study I have focused on breast cancer detection using deep learning.


## Motivation
- Breast cancer is one of the most common cancer diseases among women. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), it accounts for 22.9% of invasive cancers and 13.7% of cancer-related deaths in women across the globe.

- Therefore, early and accurate diagnosis is critical as it can minimise the death rate and improve the prognosis of breast cancer.

- Since manual diagnosis is a tedious task, there exists an imperative need to automate breast cancer detection using deep learning.


## CNN Architecture Used
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used comprises of the following architecture:
- Three convolutional layers with 16, 32 and 64 filters respectively, using the Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) activation function.
- A max pooling layer after every convolutional layer with a pool size of 2.
- After the series of convolutional and pooling layers, there exists four fully connected layers with 512, 256, 128 and 64 neurons respectively.
- Finally, in the CNN there exists an output layer with three neurons corresponding to three classes- Normal, Benign and Cancer.

The aforementioned CNN architecture can be graphically seen below.

## Experimentation
- Initially built a Logistic Regression based Machine Learning model using the numerical dataset with ~96% accuracy (More details about the datasets used can be found in the end).

- To further automate feature detection and extraction process in mammogram images, built a CNN based Deep Learning model and increased its accuracy from 66.6% to 88.8%


## Conclusion
- My current work focused on automating the detection and classification of breast cancer in mammogram images using deep learning approaches.

- Due to the unavailablity of large and noise-free datasets, my experimentation that was based on a limited number of samples, manual noise-removal methods and different combinations of optimisers achieved a maximum accuracy of 88.8%


## Future Directions
- In the future, I would like to automate the noise-removal process using sophisticated image processing techniques based on Median filters and Gaussian filters to name a few.

- The automation would lead to the generation of a large number of samples which would better train the CNN and ultimately lead to a better accuracy.


## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- At the onset, it was observed that most of the images in the image datasets were not in a standardised format. The images contained noise in terms of annotations and artefacts which were introduced due to malfunctioning of the device and/or poor illumination.

- Proceeding further, the annotated images were filtered out and the artefacts were eliminated by creating a uniform black background in a subset of the images.

- These processes were manually performed (leading to fewer samples) and in the future I would like to automate them.


## Datasets Used
[Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic):](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29) 
- This dataset is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains textual features that are computed from a digitised image of a Fine Needle Aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The features describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image, such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry and fractal dimension.
- It contains 357 Benign samples and 212 Malignant samples.

[The Miniâ€“MIAS Database of Mammograms:](http://peipa.essex.ac.uk/info/mias.html)
- The Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) is an organisation of research groups based out of the UK interested in mammography research. They have put together a database of digital mammograms that have been padded and reduced to a 200-micron pixel edge such that all the images are of dimension 1024 x 1024.
- It contains 56 Benign samples and 52 Malignant samples.

[Mini-DDSM:](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cheddad/miniddsm)
- The Mini-DDSM is a lightweight version of the popular but now obsolete DDSM (Digital Database for Screening Mammography) dataset. The DDSM database, which was compiled for research purposes by South Florida University, has 2,620 scanned film mammography studies organised into 43 volumes. Expert radiologists have recognised and annotated benign and malignant tumours in all mammograms.
- It contains 2,728 Normal samples, 3,360 Benign samples and 3,596 Cancer samples.
